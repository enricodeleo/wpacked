# WPacked

**WPacked** tries to give you an easy development starter kit easy to maintain and deploy, **within a clean pure local environment**. Just like you usually do with npm.

No more XAMP/MAMP or virtual machines, or other (often conflicting) softwares on your local machines.
**You just need PHP**.

Clean, versionable, quick.

## New! Heroku/Dokku ready

This project will be automatically built and ready to go just pushing the repository itself to Heroku or Heroku-like environments like Dokku. It will be ran under nginx (slightly optimized with gzip and assets caching).

## Background

I really like developing using the Node.js-ecosystem. I love to make my projects modular with npm and bower, I adore the easy dependency management.
The thing I like the most is that I can start working immediately on my local machine without a full fledged webserver.

Of course there are tools that give you quickly(sh) a development server within your machine, (I'm personally a big fan of [roots/bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock), that inspired this project) but all of them need a Vagrant virtual machine. Quite an overkill for most project.

I also like the idea of just dropping a project on a webserver when I'm done (almost impossible with MySQL).

I tried to create a lovely and easy development flow with my favorite CMS, so here we are: my attempt to make WordPress as a self contained, _packaged application_ as possible. Hope you enjoy it ;)

## Slideshare presentation

## Key features

* Git-friendly
* Dependency management via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* Containerizable

## Requirements

* A Unix-like OS
* PHP >= 7.4
* Composer
* MySQL/MariDB

## Requirements installation

### OS X

The best way to manage packages and installations on your Mac is _Homebrew_.
If you haven't it yet, well you should. Follow the instructions [on the Homebrew's official website](http://brew.sh/).

Suggested to update homebrew to the latest version

```bash
$ brew update && brew upgrade
```

Then install the php version of your choice with

```bash
$ brew install php
```

You'll need also Composer, so let install it:

```bash
brew install composer
```

For a local database:

```bash
brew install mariadb
```

#### Optional

Optional but suggested [wp-cli](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli). It'll speed up several operations giving you the possibility to issue commands to WordPress via terminal.
This repo has a wp-cli.yml that automatically will point wp-cli to the actual wordpress directory, you just need to use the `wp` command inside the project directory.

```bash
brew install wp-cli
```

### Linux

- todo, feel free to make a pull request -

## Usage

Now the reason of the all thing: instant development. Just two commands.

Clone this repo and type

```bash
composer install
```

in order to install all the dependencies of the project.

**You are already done**, just launch the built-in web server with

```bash
composer run serve --timeout=0
```

and visit the default location [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) :rocket:

## Adding WordPress plugins

In a proper composer/git-driven workflow you want to add 3rd parties plugins via composer. You can find all the free plugins available in the WP ecosystem on [WordPress Packagist](https://wpackagist.org/).

Example of plugin installation (digit in your shell):

```bash
composer require "wpackagist-plugin/jetpack":"8.5"
```

## WP Configuration

Thanks to phpdotenv you can store your configurations outside the public directory in a `.env` file. You'll find the file `.env.example` that you need to copy to `.env` within the root directory of the project with the following variables:

|**variable name** |**role**|
|------------------|--------|
| ENVIRNOMENT      | the environment where the app lives in (development, staging, production) |
| WP_HOME          | the url of the website|
| WP_SITEURL       | the url of the wordpress directory, here is urlofthesite.ltd/wordpress|
| DB_NAME          | name of the MySQL DB|
| DB_USER          | user of the MySQL DB|
| DB_PASSWORD      | password of the MySQL DB|
| DB_HOST          | host of the MySQL DB|
| FORCE_SSL        | `1` in order to force SSL (redirects all requests to https://)|
| DISABLE_WP_CRON  | whether or not the app should use the WP cron system (false requires setting up cron manually on your server)|

**For security purposes, don't forget to set AUTH_KEY, SECURE_AUTH_KEY, LOGGED_IN_KEY, NONCE_KEY, AUTH_SALT, SECURE_AUTH_SALT, LOGGED_IN_SALT, NONCE_SALT to different (long) random strings on production.**

**NOTE**
Don't commit the `.env` file, it's very likely that you want sapearate settings for each copy of the project. e.g. different urls for each environment like website.dev, staging.website.com and website.com. Just set those domains on each respective .env and you're ready to go :)

## Development custom php.ini

You can customize all php configurations without touching your default/system's php.ini *while using the built-in web server*.

Just edit the [`./php-server.ini`](php-server.ini) file under the [ini] section.

## Deploy :zap:

You can just upload it to your server and point the webserver of your choice to `/path/to/project/app` or build and deploy your docker image.


## How to add WordPress Plugins

All the php dependencies are managed by Composer, the same happens for WordPress plugins (of course if they are commodities and not custom ones). You can find all the packagist entries for WordPress plugins on the [WPackagist official website](http://wpackagist.org/).

For example, searching for buddypress would return something like `"wpackagist-plugin/buddypress":"4.2.0"`, you just need to drop this line inside the `composer.json`'s `require` section and type

```bash
composer update
```

The whole plugins directory is under `.gitignore`, so if you add custom plugins you need to exclude them (you'll find an example within the .gitignore file) and add them to git.

_________________________________________

## Docker ðŸ†•

A docker file and docker-compose are now included for building and local development with MariaDB and Nginx included.

### Local development

Run `docker compose up` in order to bring up the entire local stack. It will start all the containers needed for a great experience. The same docker-compose could also be seen as a starting point for your production configuration if you're using e.g. *docker swarm*.

The local development stack features:
- A wordpress container powered by Php8, Nginx, Composer
- MariaDB
- Adminer for database operations through the browser
- An nginx reverse proxy so that you can access your new website via domain not localhost

Thanks to the reverse proxy you'll access the website at `http://wordpress.local` and adminer at `http://adminer.local`.

#### Accessing local domains

You need to add these lines in your `hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1 wordpress.local
127.0.0.1 adminer.local
```

#### Run commands inside the Wordpress container

```bash
docker compose run --rm wordpress /bin/sh
```

### Building

From root ofthis project run `docker build .` in order to build a docker image.
